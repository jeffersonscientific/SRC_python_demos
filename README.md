Included area a handful of simple Python code snippets intended to demonstrate varous aspects of Python programming, especially as they apply to HPC environments. HPC codes will likely focus on SRC's Sherlock HPC environment, including examples that load modules and otherwise use Sherlock software.

Undoubtedly, this repo will borrow (steal...) quite a bit from Carpentries and other instructional sources. This Carpentries tutorial includes a couple of great examples that can be used to illustrate various stages of computational optimization (eg, loop-loop, vectorization, `numba`, various approaches to parallelization.
